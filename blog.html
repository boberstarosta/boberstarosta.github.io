					<p>I got up late today, finally, I've waken up at 6am or some such ridiculously early hour lately. I slept properly in bed this night, not on the couch, and I felt a little bit ill in the morning. I'm not sure if that's because of dirty sheets or is it too hot and dry upstairs.</p>
					<p>Work went ok, got a bit bored. Still no motivation to do anything, just bare minimum. I wrote a snake game in JavaScript to aleviate boredom. Some retards as usual. One old guy was seriously fucked up in the brains. I'm sure he genuinely believed he's smart, but his shaking hands and mad eyes told a different story.</p>
					<p>I visited the Dworcowa post office, first time in months. I met both Pani Jola and Pani Ania there, it gave me a warm feeling to see them again. Pani Jola looks visibly older, but she's still good. Pani Ania seemed to be quicker than she used to, not very much, but still.</p>
					<p>Parchimowicz came to get some of his stuff today. He's so fucking toxic, he wasn't even mean or anything, I got anxious just because of his very presence. I wonder how his and dad's settlement really looks like.</p>
					<p>MÅ‚oda was going to some concert or something tonight, so we didn't drive back from work together. I took a train instead. The schedule keeps getting worse, with trains more than 2 hours apart in the afternoon. I had to leave work much earlier, at about 16.30. The train ride was nice, I had an entire 4-seat section for myself. While I was waiting for my train, I wandered around the station a bit. I haven't seen the new roofed walkway yet. There's KFC in the station. Good thing we didn't have it when we worked there, or we would eat that shit every day probably.</p>
					<p>I very much enjoyed the walk home from the station. I forgot to buy dad's lotto coupons, I reminded myself about it only after I walked most of the way. No problem, I walked back to the store. The weather was really nice.</p>
					<p>When I went to give dad his coupons, I expected mum to open the door, but dad opened, without his crutches. When I drove him from the hospital, he seemed weak and in pain, but i guess i misjudged his condition, he's really ok.</p>
					<p>At home, I finished the snake game I begun at work. It's now playable and a perfectly good simple browser game. Only things I might add are save/load options via cookies and a leaderboar, altough that would probably require a database, and my goal is to make the game run on a static web page.</p>
					<p>I finished yesterday's bottle of mead as soon as i got back, and later I opened another one. It's just so good, I can't resist. I even got a little drunk. Hopefully I won't be hungover in the morning.</p>
					<p>I was thinking what game to play, tried Civilization 5 and abandoned it. Then i remembered The Settlers 2 and downloaded the game. It won't run on Windows 8 so I had to install DosBox, but I got it running eventually. This game is amazing. It's like 20 years old and still excellent. I Started the first campaign and completed the first 3 missions of the Roman campaign. Took me several hours, but it was fun.</p>
